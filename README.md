# spring-boot-in-action
Exercises from the Book "Spring Boot in Action"

## Process List
This simple application is mainly used for performance analysis and comparison between <a href="http://www.inspectit.rocks/">inspectIt</a> and <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready">spring boot actuator</a>.
Also, I didn't want to create an application without a purpose. Therefore this web application will serve as a platform, where you can create a 'To-Do-List' of movies you want to watch, books you want to read or music you want to hear.
Additional features may be added in future.

## To be fixed in future
* separate by Layer and Domains
* create 'Services'
* use bootstrap
